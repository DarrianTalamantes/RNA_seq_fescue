# Objective: I can not connect the output of interproscan to feature counts.

# Interproscan and transdecoder can connect.
# Feature counts can connect to scallop2 output
# between scallop2 and transdecoder is bedtools, this is most likely were the renaming of geneIDs comes into play
# Lets see how we can fix that        
        
        
        
        
bedtools getfasta -fullHeader -fi /scratch/drt83172/Wallace_lab/RNA_SEQ/Genome/tall_fescuev0.1.fa -bed /scratch/drt83172/Wallace_lab/RNA_SEQ/transcriptome/Fescue_transcriptome.gtf -fo /scratch/drt83172/Wallace_lab/RNA_SEQ/transcriptome/predicted_transcripts_practice.fasta
        
        # The -name did not add the geneID, it kinda just added "exon" or "transcript"
        
        
        
# Interpro scan name breakdown
ptg000001l:11633099-11936801.p442
ptg000001l = contig
11633099 = start position if you add +1
11936801 = end position
p442 = ??

My idea to fix this situation is to switch the column 3 that contains "exon" and "transcript" with the gene ID. this will then allow bed tools to keep the geneID going fowrd. 

#I used the python script gtf_col3_switch.py to make column 3 into the gene.

#Edited config file by adding _col3switch

# dag map maker
snakemake --dag --use-conda --cores 2  -s RNAseq.smk --verbose | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf


Maybe it is best if I convert the interproscan gff3 to a gtf file. Then run featurecounts with that gtf file instead of the scallop output
gffread my.gff3 -T -o my.gtf

gffread did not work for gff3. Using AGAT/1.1.0.
agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff interproscan_Practice_results.gff3 -o interproscan_Practice_results.gtf 

# gffread did not work, agat did not work.
